### My neomutt configuration

1. Edit neomuttrc with your own email
2. move `neomuttrc` to `~/.config/neomutt/neomuttrc`
3. move `mailcap` to `~/.mailcap`
4. optionally copy the contents of `formatting.vim` into your `.vimrc` or
`init.vim`.  It will format emails back and forth on read/write, so you can
check that it's okay with `:w` before you `:wq`
5. ???
6. Profit
